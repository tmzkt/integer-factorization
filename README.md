# integer-factorization
Factors a number into a product of prime integers using well-known methods
The output of this project is an executable that will factor a given number by using the Trial Division method.
The primary intention of this project is to make source code available for these algorithms.

## Methods
1. Trial Division
2. Pollard Rho
3. Fermat
